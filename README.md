# ðŸ“± Notes App - Learning Swift

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction  
This repository contains a simple **Notes App** built with SwiftUI. The main purpose of this project is to practice and apply Swift concepts as I learn them.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Created This Project  
I am currently learning **Swift** and **SwiftUI**, and I wanted to build a real-world project to experiment with different concepts. This app allows users to **create, edit, and manage notes** while implementing key SwiftUI techniques.  

## ðŸš€ What I Learned & Implemented  
This project includes various **Swift** and **SwiftUI** concepts such as:  

- âœ… **Layout Composition** - Structuring UI elements efficiently.  
- âœ… **List & ForEach** - Displaying dynamic lists of notes.  
- âœ… **App Architecture** - Structuring the project in a clean and scalable way.  
- âœ… **State Management with @State** - Managing UI updates with state.  
- âœ… **Form Handling** - Creating interactive forms to input notes.  
- âœ… **Gestures** - Implementing user gestures like swipe and tap.  
- âœ… **Alerts & Modals** - Displaying alerts and modals for user interactions.  
- âœ… **ViewModel & @ObservedObject** - Applying MVVM architecture.  
- âœ… **Shared Data with @EnvironmentObject** - Passing data across views.  
- âœ… **@Binding** - Two-way data binding between parent and child views.  
- âœ… **NavigationStack** - Implementing navigation between screens.
